<h1>SPCSS Demo</h1>
<p>
  SPCSS is a simple and minimal stylesheet for simple text-based
  websites. To learn more about it and how to use it, visit <a
  href="https://github.com/susam/spcss">github.com/susam/spcss</a>. This
  page demonstrates how some common HTML elements are styled with this
  stylesheet.
</p>
<h2 id="heading-anchor">Heading Anchor<a href="#heading-anchor"></a></h2>
<p>
  When you hover your cursor (mouse pointer) on the section heading
  above, a hash sign appears to its right. This is a heading anchor
  link. Heading anchor links are useful for sharing direct links to
  sections of a web page.
</p>
<p>
  Heading anchor links are enabled with a special feature of SPCSS: If a
  heading element contains an empty anchor element, SPCSS turns that
  into an anchor link that becomes visible while hovering the cursor on
  the heading. For example, the above heading is created with the
  following HTML code:
</p>
<pre>
<code>&lt;h2 id="heading-anchor"&gt;Heading Anchor&lt;a href="#heading-anchor"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;</code>
</pre>
<p>
  If a heading element does not have an empty anchor element within it,
  then no heading anchor link is created. For example, the top-level
  heading of this page does not have an empty anchor element, so it is
  rendered as a plain heading without an anchor link.
</p>
<h2 id="code-block">Code Block<a href="#code-block"></a></h2>
<p>
  Here is a code block that displays the famous "hello, world" program
  written in C:
</p>
<pre>
<code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main()
{
    printf("hello, world\n");
    return 0;
}</code>
</pre>
<p>
  On a Unix or Unix-like system, this program can be compiled to a
  binary executable named <code>a.out</code> with the <code>cc</code>
  command as shown below.
</p>
<pre>
<samp>$ <kbd>cc hello.c &amp;&amp; ./a.out</kbd>
hello, world</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  The command displayed in green above denotes keyboard input entered by
  a user. SPCSS considers any text in <code>&lt;kbd&gt;</code> element
  nested within a <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> element is considered to be
  keyboard input and highlighted in green by SPCSS. For example, the
  above code example was created with the following HTML code:
</p>
<pre>
<code>&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;samp&gt;$ &lt;kbd&gt;cc hello.c &amp;amp;&amp;amp; ./a.out&lt;/kbd&gt;
hello, world&lt;/samp&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Here is a code block with a wide ruler that can be helpful to see how
  much horizontal and vertical space a certain amount of code consumes:
</p>
<pre>
<code>1---5---10---15---20---25---30---35---40---45---50---55---60---65---70---75---80---85---90---95--100--105--110--115--120--125--130--135--140--145--150--155--160--165--170--175--180--185--190--195--200--205--210--215--220--225--230--235--240--245--250--255--260--265--270--275--280--285--290--295--300

</pre>
<p>
  Since the above code block is too wide to fit within the width of the
  HTML body, SPCSS makes it horizontally scrollable.
</p>
<h2 id="blockquote">Blockquote<a href="#blockquote"></a></h2>
<p>
  This section shows a few examples of the
  <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> element.
</p>
<p>
  In a letter to Robert Hooke in 1675, Issac Newton famously wrote,
</p>
<blockquote>
  If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.
</blockquote>
<p>
  In a later memoir, Newton wrote:
</p>
<blockquote>
  I do not know what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem to
  have been only like a boy playing on the sea-shore, and diverting
  myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell
  than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered
  before me.
</blockquote>

  on Issac Newton</a>.
</p>
<h2 id="image">Image<a href="#image"></a></h2>
<p>
  This section shows an example of <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> nested
  within a <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> element. The caption is created
  with <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code> within the same
  <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> element.
</p>
<figure>
  <a href="https://i.imgur.com/UrJrpo1.png"><img
      src="https://i.imgur.com/UrJrpo1.png"
       alt="Screenshot of Digger original PC booter version"></a>
  <figcaption>
    Digger original PC booter version running in DOSBox
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  SPCSS styles the <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> element to center-align
  all its content. That is why the caption appears centered. The font
  size of the caption is made smaller. The original width of the image
  above exceeds the width of the HTML body, however SPCSS ensures that
  the rendered width of any image on the page does not exceed the width
  of the HTML body. This prevents the page layout from appearing broken.
</p>
<h2 id="more">More<a href="#more"></a></h2>
<p>
  Apart from the features described above, SPCSS has the following
  additional features:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Support for dark color theme. By default, this page shows dark text
    on light background. However, on a system or web browser with dark
    theme enabled, SPCSS automatically selects light foreground colors
    on a dark background.
  </li>
  <li>
    Maximum width for the HTML body in order to prevent the lines of
    text from becoming too long. Shorter lines are easier to read.
  </li>
  <li>
    In light mode, the text color is dark gray (<code>#333</code>)
    instead of black (<code>#000</code>). This reduces the contrast a
    little bit which some people find more pleasant.
  </li>
  <li>
    Increased line-height to add more room around the lines.
  </li>
  <li>
    More margin above headings to separate them more conspicuously from
    preceding content.
  </li>
  <li>
    Less margin below headings as well as less line-height for margins
    to associate them more tightly with succeeding content.
  </li>
</ul>
